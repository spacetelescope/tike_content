# Timeseries Integrated Knowledge Engine (TIKE) Content
This repository contains the curated information to learn how to use and access the data associated with the TESS and Kepler missions on the MAST-hosted science platform. This repo contains documents and code which teaches how to best use NASA's Kepler and TESS time series missions. It also demonstrates how to make use of the cloud-hosted data and the AWS computational environment when analyzing these data.

This repo is intended to contain community driven content. If you see topics that are missing, users are encouraged to either open an issue or create a pull request. Several topics are left undone in the hopes that others will contribute content to this repo as appropriate.
