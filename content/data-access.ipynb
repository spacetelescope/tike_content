    "The [MAST data archive](https://archive.stsci.edu/) provides a copy of several large NASA data sets via Amazon Web Services (AWS) as part of the [MAST AWS Public Datasets](https://registry.opendata.aws/collab/stsci/) program.\n",
    "\n",
    "This service is of interest to TIKE users, because the TIKE platform is hosted by AWS and therefore provides fast access to these data sets. The data are free to access and download: they do not require you to have an AWS account or use AWS credentials.\n",

    "## Which data sets are available in the cloud?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of writing, selected data sets from Hubble, Kepler, K2, and TESS are available via the AWS S3 cloud file storage service.  You can read more details about this service via the following MAST blog posts:\n",
