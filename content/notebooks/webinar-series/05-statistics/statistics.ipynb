But one big improvement that we wanted over the Lomb-Scargle periodogram was principled uncertainties on the period.

Essentially, this means that we will explore the likelihood function so that we can see how wide the peak is.\n",

This efficient exploration allows us to understand the shape of the posterior distribution without performing too many Gaussian Process calculations.\n",

The intuition here is that the trend line only does a little bit better at fitting the data than a flat line, and it needs a whole extra parameter to do so. Therefore, we might as well say that a flat line describes the data as well as a trend line.\n",
