    "### Imports and Adjustments\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, when writing code the import statements are the very first things written. An \"import\" adds code not included in default (or \"base\") Python. For example, [astroquery.mast](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html) is a package that makes it easy to search for astronomy data in the [MAST Archive](https://archive.stsci.edu). Since most people are not astronomers, this is not a part of base Python. Let's be explicit about why we need these imports:\n",
    "* `astropy.io` : we need this to open the FITS files containing our TESS data\n",
    "* `astroquery.mast` : this makes it easy to query MAST for TESS data\n",
    "* `matplotlib` : we only do this import so that we can change the DPI below\n",
    "* `matplotlib.pyplot` : this gives us the tools for making pleasant-looking plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the imports, we make some minor adjustments to the DPI, to increase the resolution of our graphs, and \"enable cloud datasets\". This second piece is important: TIKE (the platform you're currently on) is hosted in the cloud. Reading data from our cloud archive is therefore much faster than trying to read from our servers in Baltimore."

    "### Searching for Observations\n",
    "This next line is the most important in the entire Notebook. `Observations.query_criteria` is a powerful way to search MAST, using [Observation metadata](https://mast.stsci.edu/api/v0/_c_a_o_mfields.html). There are many criteria you can search on, so let's focus on the three we use here.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `target_name` is not often used, as you would need to know in advance _exactly_ how the observer or mission labeled it. Fortunately in this case, the TESS mission uses a standard set of names from the [TESS Input Catalog](https://tess.mit.edu/science/tess-input-catalogue/). Be careful using this field for other searches!\n",
    "2. `obs_collection` translates to \"mission\". Specifying TESS greatly reduces the number of Observations to search through which in turns makes our search faster.\n",
    "3. `sequence_number` is used for Kepler/K2/TESS quarters and sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we are using the variables from above here, but you could use the actual values. For example, you could specify `sequence_number=61`."
